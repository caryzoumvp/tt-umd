# Dram view parameters are used by tt-metal and are not recognized by UMD.
# Eth and worker dram endpoints represent subchannel id from dram array for each noc.
# For example, a dram view where channel is 0 and worker_endpoint is [1, 2] would resolve to dram core at position [0,2] for noc1 which is 0-11.
